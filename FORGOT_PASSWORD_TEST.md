# Forgot Password Functionality Test Guide

## âœ… Issue Fixed!

The `TransportException` error has been resolved by changing the mail configuration from SMTP to log driver.

### What was the problem?
- Your application was configured to use `MAIL_HOST=mailpit` 
- "mailpit" is not a valid hostname on your local Windows machine
- This caused the connection error when trying to send password reset emails

### What was changed?
- Changed `MAIL_MAILER=smtp` to `MAIL_MAILER=log`
- Updated `MAIL_HOST=mailpit` to `MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1`
- Cleared configuration cache

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Forgot Password Functionality

### Step 1: Access the Application
Your development server is running at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

### Step 2: Test the Forgot Password Flow

1. **Go to the forgot password page:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/forgot-password
   ```

   - Email input field
   - "Send Password Reset Email" button
